Once a month, web developers from across the Mozilla Project get together to
develop an encryption scheme that is resistant to bad actors yet able to be
broken by legitimate government entities. While we toil away, we find time to
talk about our side projects and drink, an occurrence we like to call "Beer and
Tell".

There's a [wiki page available][wiki] with a list of the presenters, as well as
links to their presentation materials. There's also a [recording
available][recording] courtesy of Air Mozilla.

## Osmose: Moseamp
[Osmose][] (that's me!) was up first, and shared [Moseamp][], an audio player.
It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but acts as a native app thanks to
the [Electron][] framework. Moseamp can play standard audio formats, and also
can load plugins to add support for extra file formats, such as
[Moseamp-Audio-Overload][] for playing [PSF][] files and [Moseamp-GME][] for
playing [NSF][] and [SPC][] files. The plugins rely on libraries written in
C that are compiled via [Emscripten][].

## Peterbe: Activity

Next was [Peterbe][] with [Activity][], a small webapp that displays the events
relevant to a project, such as pull requests, PR comments, bug comments, and
more, and displays the events in a nice timeline along with the person related
to the action. It currently pulls data from Bugzilla and Github.

The project was born from the need to help track a single individual's
activities related to a project, even if they have different usernames on
different services. Activity can help a project maintainer see what contributors
are doing and determine if there's anything they can do to help the contributor.

## New One: MXR to DXR

[New One][] was up next with a Firefox add-on called [MXR to DXR][]. The add-on
rewrites all links to [MXR][] viewed in Firefox to point to the equivalent page
on [DXR][], the successor to MXR. The add-on also provides a hotkey for
switching between MXR and DXR while browsing the sites.

## bwalker: Liturgiclock

Last was [bwalker][] who shared [liturgiclock][], which is a webpage showing a
year-long view of what religious texts that Lutherans are supposed to read
throughout the year based on the date. The site uses a [Node.js][] library that
provides the data on which text belongs to which date, and the visualization
itself is powered by SVG and [D3.js][].

We don't actually know how to go about designing an encryption scheme, but we're
hoping to run a Kickstarter to pay for the Udacity cryptography course. We're
confident that after being certified as cryptologists we can make real progress
towards our dream of swimming in pools filled with government cash.

If you're interested in attending the next Beer and Tell, sign up for the
[dev-webdev@lists.mozilla.org mailing list][mailing-list]. An email is sent out
a week beforehand with connection details. You could even add yourself to the
wiki and show off your side-project!

See you next month!
