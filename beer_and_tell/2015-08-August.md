Once a month, web developers from across the Mozilla Project get together to
spend an hour of overtime to honor our white-collar brethren at Amazon. As we
watch our productivity fall, we find time to talk about our side projects and
drink, an occurrence we like to call "Beer and Tell".

There's a [wiki page available][wiki] with a list of the presenters, as well as
links to their presentation materials. There's also a [recording
available][recording] courtesy of Air Mozilla.

## openjck: Discord
[openjck][] was up first and shared [Discord][], a Github webhook that scans
pull requests for CSS compatibility issues. When it finds an issue, it leaves a
comment on the offending line with a short description and which browsers are
affected. The check is powered by [doiuse][], and projects can add a `.doiuse`
file (using [browserslist syntax][]) that specifies which browser versions they
want to be tested against. Discord currently checks CSS and [Stylus][] files.

The Discord team ([mrmakeit][], [groovecoder][], [davidwalsh][], and
[openjck][]) is looking for sites to test Discord out. Work on the site is
currently suspended (which is why it's a side project, the team may work on it
in their free time) so that feedback can be gathered to determine where the site
should go next. If you're interested in trying out Discord, let [groovecoder][]
know!

## peterbe: Activity and Fanout.io
Next up was [peterbe][], with an update to [Activity][]. The site now uses
[Fanout.io][] and a message queue to improve how activity items are fetched from
GitHub and other sources. The site queues up jobs to fetch data from the Github
API, and as the jobs complete, they send their results to Fanout. Fanout's
JavaScript library maintains an open [WebSocket][] with their service, and when
Fanout receives the data from the completed jobs, it notifies the client of the
new data, which gets written to `localStorage` and updates the [React][] state.
This allows Activity to remain structured as an offline-ready application while
still receiving seamless updates if the user has an internet connection.
