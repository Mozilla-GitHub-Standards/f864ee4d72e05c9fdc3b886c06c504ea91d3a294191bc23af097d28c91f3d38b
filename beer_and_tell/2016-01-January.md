Once a month, web developers from across the Mozilla Project get together to
talk about our side projects and drink, an occurrence we like to call
"Beer and Tell".

There's a [wiki page available][wiki] with a list of the presenters, as well as
links to their presentation materials. There's also a [recording
available][recording] courtesy of Air Mozilla.

## shobson: CSS-Only Disco Ball
First up was [shobson][] with a cool demo of an [animated disco ball made
entirely with CSS][]. The demo uses a repeated radial gradient for the
background, and linear gradients plus a border radius for the disco ball itself.
The demo was made for use in shobson's [WordCamp talk][] about debugging CSS. A
[blog post][] with notes from the talk is available as well.

## craigcook: Proton - A CSS Framework for Prototyping
Next was [craigcook][], who presented [Proton][]. It's a CSS framework that is
intentionally ugly to encourage use for prototypes only. Unlike other CSS
frameworks, the temptation to reuse the classes from the framework in your final
page doesn't occur, which helps avoid the presentational classes that plague
sites built using a framework normally.

Proton's website includes an overview of the layout and components provided, as
well as examples of prototypes made using the framework.
