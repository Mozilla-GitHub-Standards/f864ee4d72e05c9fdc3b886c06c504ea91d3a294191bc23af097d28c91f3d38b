Once a month, web developers from across the Mozilla Project get together to
talk about our side projects and drink, an occurrence we like to call "Beer and
Tell".

There's a [wiki page available][wiki] with a list of the presenters, as well as
links to their presentation materials. There's also a [recording
available][recording] courtesy of Air Mozilla.

## Osmose: Mandelbrot in Rust
First up was [Osmose][], who showed off a [Rust][] program he "wrote" that
generates a PNG of the [Mandelbrot set][]. And by "wrote", he means he copied it
from an in-progress book on Rust called ["Programming Rust"][] by fellow
Mozillian [jimb][]. The book uses the Mandelbrot example to illustrate how easy
writing safe parallel code in Rust is. The book is available as an in-progress
Early Release from O'Reilly, and is aimed towards people with prior programming
experience, especially in another systems programming language.

## Peterbe: PodcastTime
Next was [peterbe][], show shared [PodcastTime][], a directory of over 13 years
of podcast metadata that shows you how much time per day, week, and month you
need to spend listening to your podcasts to keep up with them. The site also
shows a calendar of upcoming and past podcasts in your list, and lets you share
your list of podcasts with others.
