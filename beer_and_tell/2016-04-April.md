Once a month, web developers from across the Mozilla Project get together to
talk about our side projects and drink, an occurrence we like to call "Beer and
Tell".

There's a [wiki page available][wiki] with a list of the presenters, as well as
links to their presentation materials. There's also a [recording
available][recording] courtesy of Air Mozilla.

## emceeaich: Memory Landscapes
First up was [emceeaich][], who shared [Memory Landscapes][], a visual memoir of
the life and career of artist and photographer Laurie Toby Edison. The project
is presented as a non-linear collection of photographs, in contrast to the
traditionally linear format of memoirs. The feature that emceeaich demoed was
"Going to Brooklyn", which gives any link a 1/5 chance of showing
[shadow pictures][] briefly before moving on to the linked photo.

## lorchard: DIY Keyboard Prototype
Next was [lorchard][], who talked about the process of making a DIY keyboard
using web-based tools. He used [keyboard-layout-editor.com][] to generate a
layout serialized in JSON, and then used [Plate & Case Builder][] to generate a CAD
file for use with a laser cutter.

A [flickr album][] is available with photos of the process.

## lorchard: Jupyter Notebooks in Space
lorchard also shared [eve-market-fun][], a [Node.js][]-based service that pulls
data from the [EVE Online][] API and pre-digests useful information about it. He
then uses a [Jupyter][] notebook to pull data from the API and analyze it to
guide his market activities in the game. Neat!

## Pomax: React Circle-Tree Visualizer
[Pomax][] was up next with a new [React][] component: [react-circletree][]! It
depicts a tree structure using segmented concentric circles. The component is
very configurable and can by styled with CSS as it is generated via SVG. While
built as a side-project, the component can be seen in use on the
[Web Literacy Framework][] website.

## Pomax: HTML5 Mahjong
Also presented by Pomax was an [HTML5 multiplayer Mahjong][] game. It allows
four players to play the classic Chinese game online by using [socket.io][] and
a Node.js server to connect the players. The frontend is built using React and
[Webpack][].

## groovecoder and John Dungan: Codesy
Last up was [groovecoder][] and John Dungan, who shared [codesy][], an
open-source startup addressing the problem of compensation for fixing bugs in
open-source software. They provide a browser extension that allows users to bid
on bugs as well as name their price for fixing a bug. Users may then provide
proof that they fixed a bug, and once it is approved by the bidders, they
receive a payout.
