Once a month, web developers from across the Mozilla Project get together to
talk about our side projects and drink, an occurrence we like to call "Beer and
Tell".

There's a [wiki page available][wiki] with a list of the presenters, as well as
links to their presentation materials. There's also a [recording
available][recording] courtesy of Air Mozilla.

## Moby von Briesen: Jam Circle
This week's only presenter was [mobyvb][], who shared [Jam Circle][], a webapp
that lets users play music together. Users who connect join a shared room and
see each other as circles connected to a central node. Using the keyboard (or,
in browsers that support it, any MIDI-capable device), users can play notes that
all other users in the channel hear and see as colored lines on each circle's
connection to the center.

The webapp also includes the beginnings of an editor that will allow users to
write chord progressions and play them alongside live playback.

A instance of the site is up and running at [jam-circle.herokuapp.com][]. Check
it out!
