Once a month, web developers from across the Mozilla Project get together to
talk about our side projects and drink, an occurrence we like to call "Beer and
Tell".

There's a [wiki page available][wiki] with a list of the presenters, as well as
links to their presentation materials. There's also a [recording
available][recording] courtesy of Air Mozilla.

## Osmose: PyJEXL
First up was [Osmose][] (that's me!), who shared [PyJEXL][], an implementation
of [JEXL][] in Python. JEXL is an expression language based on JavaScript that
computes the value of an expression when applied to a given context. For
example, the statement `2 + foo`, when applied to a context where `foo` is 7,
evaluates to 9. JEXL also allows for defining custom functions and operators to
be used in expressions.

JEXL is implemented as a JavaScript library; PyJEXL allows you to parse and
evaluate JEXL expressions in Python, as well as analyze and validate
expressions.

## pmac: rtoot.org
Next up was [pmac][], who shared [rtoot.org][], the website for "The Really
Terrible Orchestra of the Triangle". It's a static site for pmac's local
orchestra built using [lektor][], an easy-to-use static site generator. One of
the more interesting features pmac highlighted was lektor's [data model][]. He
showed a [lektor plugin][csv] he wrote that added support for CSV fields as part
of the data model, and used it to describe the orchestra's rehearsal schedule.

The site is deployed as a [Docker][] container on a [Dokku][] instance. Dokku
replicates the [Heroku][] style of deployments by accepting Git pushes to
trigger deploys. Dokku also has a great [Let's Encrypt][] plugin for setting up
and renewing HTTPS certificates for your apps.

## groovecoder: Scary/Tracky JS
Next was [groovecoder][], who previewed a lightning talk he's been working on
called "Scary JavaScript (and other Tech) that Tracks You Online". The talk
gives an overview of various methods that sites can use to track what sites
you've visited without your consent. Some examples given include:

- Reading the color of a link to a site to see if it is the "visited link"
  color (this has been fixed in most browsers).
- Using [requestAnimationFrame][] to time how long it took the browser to draw a
  link; visited links will take longer as the browser has to change their color
  and then remove it to avoid the previous vulnerability.
- Embed a resource from another website as a video, and time how long it takes
  for the browser to attempt and fail to parse the video; a low time indicates
  the resource was served from the cache and you've seen it before.
- [Cookie Syncing][]

groovecoder plans to give the talk at a few local conferences, leading up to
the [Hawaii All Hands][] where he will give the talk to Mozilla.

## rdalal: Therapist
[rdalal][] was next with [Therapist][], a tool to help create robust,
easily-configurable pre-commit hooks for Git. It is configured via a [YAML][]
file at your project root, and can run any command you want to run before
committing code, such as code linting or build commands. Therapist is also able
to detect which files were changed by the commit and only run commands on those
to help save time.

## gregtatum: River - Paths Over Time
Last up was [gregtatum][], who shared [River - Paths Over Time][river]. Inspired
by the sight of rivers from above during the flight back from the London All
Hands, Rivers is a simulation of rivers flowing and changing over time. The
animation is drawn on a 2d canvas using rectangles that are drawn and then
slowly faded over time; this slow fade creates the illusion of "drips" seeping
into the ground as rivers shift position.

The [source code][riversource] for the simulation is available on Github, and
is configured with several parameters that can be tweaked to change the behavior
of the rivers.
