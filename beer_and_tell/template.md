Once a month, web developers from across the Mozilla Project get together to
talk about our side projects and drink, an occurrence we like to call "Beer and
Tell".

There's a [wiki page available][wiki] with a list of the presenters, as well as
links to their presentation materials. There's also a [recording
available][recording] courtesy of Air Mozilla.

If you're interested in attending the next Beer and Tell, sign up for the
[dev-webdev@lists.mozilla.org mailing list][mailing-list]. An email is sent out
a week beforehand with connection details. You could even add yourself to the
wiki and show off your side-project!

See you next month!
