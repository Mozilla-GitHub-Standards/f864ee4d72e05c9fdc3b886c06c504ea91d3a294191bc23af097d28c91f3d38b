<p>Once a month, web developers from across Mozilla get together to practice our competitive placation skills. While we aggressively refine our concessions, we find time to talk about the work that we've shipped, share the libraries we're working on, meet new folks, and talk about whatever else is on our minds. It's the Webdev Extravaganza! The meeting is open to the public; you should stop by!</p>

<p>You can check out the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webdev/Meetings/2015/April_7">wiki page</a> that we use to organize the meeting, or view a <a href="https://air.mozilla.org/webdev-extravaganza-april-2015/">recording of the meeting</a> in Air Mozilla. Or just read on for a summary!</p>

<h2>Shipping Celebration</h2>
<p>The shipping celebration is for anything we finished and deployed in the past month, whether it be a brand new site, an upgrade to an existing one, or even a release of a library.</p>

<h3>Webdev Project Listing</h3>
<p><a href="https://mozillians.org/u/Osmose/">I myself</a> presented first, and shared <a href="http://mozilla.github.io/webdev/">mozilla.github.io/webdev</a>, a list of Mozilla projects related to Web Development. The site pulls metadata from Github as well as <a href="http://contribute.paas.allizom.org/">contribute.json</a> files when available, and is built and updated by <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> whenever a change lands on master. A small instance of <a href="https://github.com/philou/daily-travis/">daily-travis</a> triggers a re-build once a day to keep the listing up-to-date.</p>

<h3>Starring Events on Air Mozilla</h3>
<p><a href="https://mozillians.org/u/peterbe/">Peterbe</a> shared the news that you can now star events on <a href="https://air.mozilla.org/">Air Mozilla</a> thanks to the work by <a href="https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/">OPW 2015</a> intern <a href="https://mozillians.org/u/bugZPDX/">Lisa Hewus Fresh</a>. Both signed-in and anonymous users can star videos; anonymous stars are saved to localstorage. Lisa also <a href="https://air.mozilla.org/starring-events-on-air-mozilla/">gave a brownbag</a> on her intern experience and the process of developing and shipping the feature.</p>

<h3>SocketPeer</h3>
<p><a href="https://mozillians.org/u/potch/">Potch</a> stopped by to let us know that <a href="https://github.com/cvan/socketpeer">SocketPeer</a>, which was presented at last month's <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/webdev/2015/03/25/beer-and-tell-march-2015/">Beer and Tell</a>, has shipped and is ready for use. The library was also featured in a <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/04/peering-through-the-webrtc-fog-with-socketpeer/">post on the Hacks blog</a>.</p>

<h2>Roundtable</h2>
<p>The Roundtable is the home for discussions that don't fit anywhere else.</p>

<h3>Django-nose broken on Django 1.8</h3>
<p>Peterbe wanted to share the news that <a href="https://github.com/django-nose/django-nose">django-nose</a> is broken on Django 1.8. There's an <a href="https://github.com/django-nose/django-nose/issues/178">open issue</a> and some pull requests with fixes, but no fix has been merged yet.</p>

<hr />

<p>This week's breakout star was willkg, with a stunning move to pay $200 a month in reparations to one of his Twitter followers in return for not following them back.</p>
