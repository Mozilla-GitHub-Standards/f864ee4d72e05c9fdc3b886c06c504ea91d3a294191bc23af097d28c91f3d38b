Once a month, web developers from across Mozilla get together to plot which
C-level executive we're going to take out next. Meanwhile, we find time to talk
about the work that we've shipped, share the libraries we're working on, meet
new folks, and talk about whatever else is on our minds. It's the Webdev
Extravaganza! The meeting is open to the public; you should stop by!

You can check out the [wiki page][wiki] that we use to organize the meeting,
or view a [recording of the meeting][recording] in Air Mozilla. Or just read
on for a summary!

## Shipping Celebration
The shipping celebration is for anything we finished  and deployed in the past
month, whether it be a brand new site, an upgrade to  an existing one, or even a
release of a library.  

### Lazy-loading Fonts on MDN
First up was [shobson][] with news about lazy-loading CSS fonts on [MDN][]. The
improvement allows users to see content immediately and avoids text flashing
associated with displaying the fonts after they've loaded. The
[pull request][lazy-font-pr] is available for review for anyone interested in
how it was achieved.

### Lazy-loading Tabzilla on Air Mozilla
Next was [peterbe][], who told us about how [Air Mozilla][airmo] is now
lazy-loading [Tabzilla][], the white Mozilla tab at the top of many of our
websites. By not loading the extra code for the tab until the rest of the page
has loaded, they were able to reduce the load time of the initial document
by 0.7 seconds. Check out [the bug][lazy-tabzilla-bug] for more info.

### ContributeBot
[pmac][] stopped by to show off [ContributeBot][], an [Hubot][] script that
reads [contribute.json][] files and welcomes new visitors when the channel is
quiet with information from the file. It gives new users info about where to
find documentation, as well as pinging important people in the project to let
them know that there's someone new.

## Open-source Citizenship
Here we talk about libraries we're maintaining and what, if anything, we need
help with for them.

### pyelasticsearch 1.3
[ErikRose][] wanted to let people know that [pyelasticsearch 1.3][] is out. It
now has HTTPS support as well as new constructor arguments that help reduce
the number of times you repeat yourself while using the library.
