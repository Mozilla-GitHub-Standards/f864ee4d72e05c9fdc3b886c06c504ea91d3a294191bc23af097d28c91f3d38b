Once a month, web developers from across Mozilla get together to dumpster dive
for hardware to add to our in-house cloud computing service. While we argue
about the compute power of TI-83s, we find time to talk about the work we've
shipped, share the libraries we're working on, meet new folks, and talk about
whatever else is on our minds. It's the Webdev Extravaganza! The meeting is open
to the public; you should stop by!

You can check out the [wiki page][wiki] we use to organize the meeting, or view
a [recording of the meeting][recording] in Air Mozilla. Or just read on for a
summary!

## Shipping Celebration
The shipping celebration is for anything we finished and deployed in the past
month, whether it be a brand new site, an upgrade to an existing one, or even a
release of a library.

### DXR search package for Atom
First up was [Osmose][] (that's me!) with a package for [Atom][], a text editor
made by Github. The package is called [atom-dxr-search][] and lets you perform
searches on [DXR][] (Mozilla's structured code search engine) from directly
within your text editor. And, if you have the code tree you're searching open as
a directory in Atom, you can click on the results to open the matching file and
jump directly to the line in question!

### Socorro: Now on AWS!
Next was [lonnen][], who shared the great news that [Socorro][], the crash
collector service that handles crash reports for Firefox and other products, has
successfully migrated off of Mozilla infrastructure and on to [AWS][]. This is
the culmination of 2-3 quarters of work by the Socorro team, and will allow the
team to scale and deploy much faster than before.

Along with the switch itself, the team set up several new tools to help deploy
and monitor the service, including [Atlas][], which lets the team to audit and
test infrastructure changes before they get deployed.

### Air Mozilla /new page
[Peterbe][] launched the [New/Upload][] page on [Air Mozilla][], which lets
users to upload existing videos or record a new video from their webcam. The
page makes it much easier to submit content to Air Mozilla, and in the future
the page will allow you to record screencasts as well.

### DXR 2.0 Demo
[ErikRose][] shared a link to [his presentation][] on the new things coming in
the [DXR][] 2.0 update, as well as a link to the
[post-presentation discussion][] on what the future roadmap for DXR looks like.

### Edwin, a tool for bug management
[Mythmon][] has been working on [Edwin][], which is a small [React][] app that
lets you manage the list of bugs to work on for a project. It pulls data from
both Bugzilla and GitHub, knows the current review status of a bug, and lets
you to sort and prioritize work easily. [SUMO][] and [Input][] are currently
using the tool to manage their work, and any projects interested in
trying the tool out can contact mythmon to get their project added.

### Pontoon on Heroku
I wrapped things up with the news that [Pontoon][], a localization service that
supports in-page translation for websites, has migrated to Heroku. The jump is
the result of work from both myself and [mathjazz][], the main developer of the
site. The migration required upgrading Django from 1.4 to 1.8, replacing Git
submodules with a [peep][]-compatible requirements file, replacing [jingo][]
with [django-jinja][], and a slew of other changes generally around removing the
last traces of [playdoh][] from the site.

In addition, the Pontoon team is looking to help anyone interested in switching
to Pontoon. If you're not using Pontoon and want to be (and you should), let me
know and I'll be able to help start the process as well as possibly contribute
patches to your site to enable in-page localization.

In the end we weren't able to find enough computers, so we opted to install
rootkits on all the company laptops that harvest unused CPU for our cloud.
