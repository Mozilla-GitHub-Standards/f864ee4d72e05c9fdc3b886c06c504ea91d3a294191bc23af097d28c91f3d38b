Once a month, web developers from across Mozilla get together to recreate
classic dishes using only soylent and food coloring. As we discover what oven
temperatures are safe for the techno-wizard goop, we find time to talk about the
work that we've shipped, share the libraries we're working on, meet new folks,
and talk about whatever else is on our minds. It's the Webdev Extravaganza! The
meeting is open to the public; you should stop by!

You can check out the [wiki page][wiki] that we use to organize the meeting, or
view a [recording of the meeting][recording] in Air Mozilla. Or just read on for
a summary!

## Shipping Celebration
The shipping celebration is for anything we finished and deployed in the past
month, whether it be a brand new site, an upgrade to an existing one, or even a
release of a library.

### Pontoon: One L10n Platform to Rule Them All
First up was [Osmose][] (that's me!) sharing the news that Pontoon [is now able
to localize Firefox, Thunderbird, and other Gecko-based apps][mathjazz], making
it a single tool capable of localizing every project across Mozilla! The
Slovenian localization team is already using it for all the projects they
actively translate, and more locales are signing up every day.

## New Hires / Interns / Volunteers / Contributors
Here we introduce any newcomers to the Webdev group, including new employees,
interns, volunteers, or any other form of contributor.

### Farewell to new_one and nolski!
Intern season is winding down, and that means beloved Webdev interns [new_one][]
and [nolski][] are leaving us! We wish them well and thank them for their hard
work. New_one already gave [a presentation on his contributions to DXR][dxr],
and nolski's presentation will be streamed on Air Mozilla on August 11th.

## Roundtable
The Roundtable is the home for discussions that don't fit anywhere else.

### React Devtools in Firefox
[Mythmon][] shared the news that the [React Developer Tools extension][devtools]
has released a [pre-release Firefox add-on][firefox-addon]. The extension allows
developers working on [React][]-based webapps to inspect the component hierarchy
on their page as well as modify state and props for debugging purposes.

While we haven't really nailed that "taste" thing, we were able to make
imitation caesar dressing by pouring the soylent into an old Hidden Valley
bottle!
