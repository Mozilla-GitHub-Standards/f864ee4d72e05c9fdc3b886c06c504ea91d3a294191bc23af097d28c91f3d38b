Once a month, web developers from across Mozilla get together to talk about the
work that we've shipped, share the libraries we're working on, meet new folks,
and talk about whatever else is on our minds. It's the Webdev Extravaganza! The
meeting is open to the public; you should stop by!

You can check out the [wiki page][wiki] that we use to organize the meeting, or
view a [recording of the meeting][recording] in Air Mozilla. Or just read on for
a summary!

## Shipping Celebration
The shipping celebration is for anything we finished and deployed in the past
month, whether it be a brand new site, an upgrade to an existing one, or even a
release of a library.

### Peep 3.1.1
First up was [ErikRose][] with news of a new release of [Peep][]. The new
version fixes the `peep port` command so that it correctly emits URL-based
requirements.

Erik also wants to remind everyone to drop Peep and upgrade to [Pip 8][].

[Pip 8]: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/

### SHIELD Recipe Server
Next up was [mythmon][], who talked about the [Recipe Server][], a system to
help Firefox respond to user issues and test new features quickly and easily.
The development server for the service is now live, and is deployed to AWS
using Docker and gunicorn.

### Go Faster System Addon Update
Next we heard from [laura][] who shared the news that the first [Go Faster][]
system addon update shipped! System addons are addons that come bundled with
Firefox, but are updated outside of the normal 6-8 week release process. They
enable us to try new features out and respond to user feedback quicker than
before.

## Roundtable
The Roundtable is the home for discussions that don't fit anywhere else.

### Debugging Python with gdb
ErikRose next talked about how he dealt with a segfault in [DXR][]'s indexing
job. The end result of his trial is a description of
[how to debug Python stack frames using gdb on Ubuntu Trusty][gdb].

### Conditional Requirements in Python are Bad
Erik also shared a story about conditional requirements in Python. Because
Python uses executable Python files for describing the requirements for
packages, some projects change their requirements list based on the environment.
For example, some projects detect whether they're running in Python 2.6 or 2.7
and include libraries that implement features that may be missing in Python 2.6.

The problem is that pip caches wheels _after_ evaluating `setup.py` files,
meaning that a cached package built for Python 2.6 may be used when installing
in Python 2.7. The solution is to use a feature called [environment markers][]
that allows packages to specify requirements against the execution environment
that they're installed to. That way package tooling can check these conditions
and avoid using cached packages that aren't appropriate for the current
environment.
