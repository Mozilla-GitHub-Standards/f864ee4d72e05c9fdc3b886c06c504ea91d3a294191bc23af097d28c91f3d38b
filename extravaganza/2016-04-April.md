Once a month, web developers from across Mozilla get together to talk about the
work that we've shipped, share the libraries we're working on, meet new folks,
and talk about whatever else is on our minds. It's the Webdev Extravaganza! The
meeting is open to the public; you should stop by!

You can check out the [wiki page][wiki] that we use to organize the meeting, or
view a [recording of the meeting][recording] in Air Mozilla. Or just read on for
a summary!

## Shipping Celebration
The shipping celebration is for anything we finished and deployed in the past
month, whether it be a brand new site, an upgrade to an existing one, or even a
release of a library.

### A-Frame v0.2.0
First up was [ngoke][], who shared the news that [A-Frame][] shipped a new
release! The v0.2.0 release focuses on extensibility by improving the Component
API and adding a slew of new objects that can be registered for use in the
framework. A [blog post][aframe-blog] is available that explains the changes.

[Let's Encrypt][] switching from [peep][] to [pip 8][] for installing its
requirements.

### DXR Indexing Most Mozilla-Central Branches
Erik also left a note mentioning that [DXR][], Mozilla's code browser and search
tool for the Firefox codebase, now indexes more branches from mozilla-central,
including Aurora, Beta, Central, ESR45, and Release.

### Pipstrap 1.1.1
The last note that Erik left mentioned that [Pipstrap][], a small script for
bootstrapping a hash-checked version of Pip, shipped a new release that fixes
an error reporting bug under Python 2.6.

### Snippets in AWS + Deis
Next up was [bensternthal][], who shared the news that [snippets.mozilla.com][]
is now hosted on Engagement Engineering's [Deis][] cluster in [AWS][]. Thanks to
[giorgos][], [jgmize][], and [pmac][] for helping to move the site over! Ben
also mentioned that [Basket][] is the next service slated to move over.

## Open-source Citizenship
Here we talk about libraries we're maintaining and what, if anything, we need
help with for them.

### New django-csp Maintainer
[pmac][] stopped by to let us know that he is taking over maintenance of
[django-csp][]. Thanks to [jsocol][] for authoring and maintaining the library
until now!

### Hashin Python Version Filtering
Last up was [peterbe][], who shared news of a new release of [hashin][]. The
main addition is a `--python-version` flag, which allows you to filter the
hashes hashin adds by python versions that you plan to use, reducing the number
hashes added. Thanks to [mythmon][] for submitting the patch!
