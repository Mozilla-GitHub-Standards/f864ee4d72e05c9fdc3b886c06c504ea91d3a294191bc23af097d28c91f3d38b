Once a month, web developers from across Mozilla get together to talk about the
work that we've shipped, share the libraries we're working on, meet new folks,
and talk about whatever else is on our minds. It's the Webdev Extravaganza! The
meeting is open to the public; you should stop by!

You can check out the [wiki page][wiki] that we use to organize the meeting, or
view a [recording of the meeting][recording] in Air Mozilla. Or just read on for
a summary!

## Shipping Celebration
The shipping celebration is for anything we finished and deployed in the past
month, whether it be a brand new site, an upgrade to an existing one, or even a
release of a library.

### Normandy, the Recipe Server
First up was [Osmose][] (that's me!), sharing the news that [Normandy][] has
shipped! Normandy is a service that will eventually power several Firefox
features that involve interacting with users and testing changes to Firefox
quickly and safely, such as recommending features that may be useful to users
or offering opportunities to try out changes. Right now the service is powering
[Heartbeat][] surveys being sent to release users.

Big thanks to the User Advocacy and Web Engineering teams for working on the
project!

### MDN Save Draft Feature
Next was [shobson][] who talked about [MDN][]'s Safe Draft feature. When editing
an MDN article, the site autosaves your edits to [localStorage][] (if it's
available). Then, when you revisit the editing interface later, the site offers
to let you restore or discard the draft, disabling autosave until a decision is
made. Future improvements may include previewing drafts and notifying users when
an article has changed since their draft was saved.

### Air Mozilla Thumbnails
[peterbe][] stopped by to talk about [Air Mozilla][]'s chapters feature, which
allows users to mark and link to segments in a video. The site now
auto-generates thumbnails for chapters to help preview what the chapter is
about.

## Roundtable
The Roundtable is the home for discussions that don't fit anywhere else.

### Docker Development Environments
Last up was [jgmize][], who asked about use of [Docker][] for easy development
environments. The general consensus was that most of the developers present
had tried using Dockerized development environments, but tended towards using it
only for deployed services or not at all.

Some of the interesting projects brought up for using Docker for development or
deployment were:

- [Docker for Mac and Windows](https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-for-mac-windows-beta/)
- [Deis](http://deis.io/)
- [Mesosphere](https://mesosphere.com/)
- [heroku-docker](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/docker)

Check 'em out!
