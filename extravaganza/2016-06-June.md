Once a month, web developers from across Mozilla get together to talk about the
work that we've shipped, share the libraries we're working on, meet new folks,
and talk about whatever else is on our minds. It's the Webdev Extravaganza! The
meeting is open to the public; you should stop by!

You can check out the [wiki page][wiki] that we use to organize the meeting, or
view a [recording of the meeting][recording] in Air Mozilla. Or just read on for
a summary!

## Shipping Celebration
The shipping celebration is for anything we finished and deployed in the past
month, whether it be a brand new site, an upgrade to an existing one, or even a
release of a library.

### Okta SSO Fix Add-on
First up was [shobson][], who shared [MoCo SSO Tweaks][], a Firefox add-on that
makes the Okta SSO flow better. Among other things, it auto-focuses the
verification code field, makes Enter submit the verification code form, and
optionally automatically checks the "Remember Device" checkbox.

### ViewSourceConf.org
Next was [hoosteeno][], who shared [viewsourceconf.org][], the website for the
2016 edition of View Source, a conference for the web that Mozilla runs. The
site is statically generated by [Metalsmith][] and takes advantage of several
plugins include the [model plugin][] and the [template plugin][] for [Swig][]
templates.

shobson worked on the frontend for the site. It intentionally avoids using
[jQuery][] and uses SVGs for small image filesizes and easy Retina support.
In the future the site will be using [Service Workers][] to enable offline
access for the site, and particularly the schedule.

### Air Mozilla Timenails
[peterbe][] stopped by to talk about the timenail support he added to
[Air Mozilla][]. A timenail is a single screenshot from a video at a specific
timestamp; a series of timenails is generated by the transcoding process and
made available in the chapter editing interface for each video to help aid in
finding good transition points for marking chapters in the video.

The site also calculates the difference between timenails and lets users filter
the timenail list to only show thumbnails that have a difference between the
previous timenail above a given threshold.

### DXR
Next up was [ErikRose][], sharing a bunch of new changes that landed in [DXR][]:

- Case-sensitivity is now inferred based on whether the search text is mixed
  case or not.
- Support for XPIDL
- 20% lower memory use
- Improved C++ analysis, including template support.

Thanks to [new_one][] and [Tom Klein][] for contributing these improvements!

### Peep 3.1.2
Erik also mentioned that [peep 3.1.2][] is out, with support for [pip 8.1.2][].

### Fathom
Erik's last mention was [Fathom][], which is an experimental framework for
extracting meaning from webpages. You provide it declarative rules that score
and classify DOM nodes, and in return it will parse a webpage and rank DOM nodes
in the page based on the given rules. You can then extract nodes from this
ranking in various ways, such as finding the highest-ranked nodes for a specific
attribute, or finding clusters of similarly-classified nodes that are close to
each other.

### Readable Bug Statuses in Bugzilla
[emceeaich][] and [dylan][] wanted to share (in absentia) the news that the
[Readable Bug Status][] package that emceeaich has been working on has been
deployed on [bugzilla.mozilla.org][] for bugs in the Firefox, Core, Toolkit, and
BMO products. Readable Bug Status helps summarize the status of a bug using
information from several fields.

### Bedrock + Gulp
Next was [pmac][] who shared the news that [Bedrock][] has switched to using
[gulp][] to help manage their frontend build and development process. The site
previously relied on [django-pipeline][] completely to manage its static assets,
but ran into issues with slow builds during development, as django-pipeline
doesn't watch for which files have changed and simply triggers a full build on
each pageview. Switching to gulp allows the site to only rebuild frontend files
that have changed, and it builds them as soon as they change instead of building
them on-demand.

For more details, pmac wrote a [blog post][] describing the switch.

## Open-source Citizenship
Here we talk about libraries we're maintaining and what, if anything, we need
help with for them.

### Google Analytics Pageviews on Non-Web Requests
peterbe shared a [blog post][] he wrote describing how to use [Raven][] to send
pageview data to [Google Analytics][]. This is useful for tracking usage of
endpoints that don't return webpages but are still considered part of your
site's public API.

### Domainswitcher
peterbe also shared [Domainswitcher][], and add-on that lets you easily switch
between domains while preserving the current path. The add-on is useful for web
developers working on sites that want to switch between prod, staging,
development, and locally-hosted instances of the site.

## New Hires / Interns / Volunteers / Contributors
Here we introduce any newcomers to the Webdev group, including new employees,
interns, volunteers, or any other form of contributor.
