Once a month, web developers from across Mozilla get together to talk about the
work that we've shipped, share the libraries we're working on, meet new folks,
and talk about whatever else is on our minds. It's the Webdev Extravaganza! The
meeting is open to the public; you should stop by!

You can check out the [wiki page][wiki] that we use to organize the meeting, or
view a [recording of the meeting][recording] in Air Mozilla. Or just read on for
a summary!

## Shipping Celebration
The shipping celebration is for anything we finished and deployed in the past
month, whether it be a brand new site, an upgrade to an existing one, or even a
release of a library.

### Basket switch to Salesforce
First up was [pmac][], who shared the news that [Basket][], email newsletter
subscription service, has switched to using [Salesforce][] as the backend for
storing newsletter subscriptions. In addition, the service now has a nifty
[public DataDog metrics dashboard][] showing off statistics about how the
service is performing.

### Engagement Engineering Status Board
Next was [giorgos][], who shared [status.mozmar.org][], a status page listing
the current status of all the services that Engagement Engineering maintains.
The status board pulls monitoring information from [Dead Man's Snitch][] as well
as [New Relic][]'s application and [Synthetics][] monitoring. The app runs a
worker using [AWS Lambda][] that pulls the information and writes it to a
[YAML][] file in the [repo][]'s gh-pages branch, and the status page itself
reads the YAML file via JavaScript to build the display.

### DXR
[ErikRose][] stopped by to share more cool things that shipped in [DXR][] this
month:

- Indexing for XBL and JavaScript.
- Indexing 32+ new projects
- Added a 3rd build server
- Several performance optimizations that cut down build times by roughly 25%.
- C++ macro definitions, method overrides, pure virtuals, substructs, and more
  are all now indexed. In addition, you can now easily jump between header files
  and their implementations.
- UI improvements, including contrast improvements, a new filename filter, and
  jumping directly to files that are the only result of a query.

Special thanks to intern [new_one][] and contributors [twointofive][] and
[abbeyj][]. Also special thanks to MXR for being shut down due to security bugs
and allowing DXR to flourish in its wake.

### Fathom 1.0 and 1.1
Erik also brought up [Fathom][], an experimental framework for extracting
meaning from webpages. Fathom allows you to write declarative rules that score
and classify DOM nodes, and then extract those nodes from a DOM that it
analyzes.

This month we shipped the 1.0 version of Fathom, as well as a 1.1 release with a
bug fix for Firefox support as well as an optimization fix. It's available as an
[NPM module][] for use as a library.
