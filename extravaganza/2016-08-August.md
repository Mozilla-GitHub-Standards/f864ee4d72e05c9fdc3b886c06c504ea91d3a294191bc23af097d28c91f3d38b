Once a month, web developers from across Mozilla get together to talk about the
work that we've shipped, share the libraries we're working on, meet new folks,
and talk about whatever else is on our minds. It's the Webdev Extravaganza! The
meeting is open to the public; you should stop by!

You can check out the [wiki page][wiki] that we use to organize the meeting, or
view a [recording of the meeting][recording] in Air Mozilla. Or just read on for
a summary!

## Shipping Celebration
The shipping celebration is for anything we finished and deployed in the past
month, whether it be a brand new site, an upgrade to an existing one, or even a
release of a library.

### Normandy Control Interface Release
First up was [mythmon][], who mentioned the new release of [Normandy][], the
backend server for the [SHIELD][] system that powers surveys and feature studies
in Firefox. This release includes a new admin interface built using [React][]
and [Redux][], as well as a switch to client-side targeting that is powered by
[JEXL][] expressions.

### Google Sign-In on Socorro
Next was [peterbe][], who mentioned that [Socorro][], the crash-report service
for Firefox, has added Google-based sign-in ahead of the
[planned shut-down of Persona][persona]. It's planned to land in production
sometime within the next week, and involves some extra work around triggering
automatic sign-out of users who have been signed in for a certain amount of
time.

### DXR: The Ballad of Peter Elmers
[ErikRose][] was next, and shared yet another list of new features developed by
[DXR][] intern [new_one][]:

- Description column in file listings
- Better handling of whitespace in paths
- Modification dates are pulled from the VCS instead of the filesystem
- Per-line blame links
- Badges in the filter dropdown showing what languages support each filter

## Open-source Citizenship
Here we talk about libraries we're maintaining and what, if anything, we need
help with for them.

### django-jinja-markdown
Next was [pmac][] in absentia, who wanted to share [django-jinja-markdown][], a
fork of [jingo-markdown][]. It adds support for rendering [Markdown][] strings
to HTML in templates rendered with [django-jinja][] via a `markdown` filter, as
well as a similarly-named template function. It also includes a block-level
template tag that can be enabled by adding the library as a Jinja extension.

### json-schema-reducer
Back to [peterbe][], who shared [json-schema-reducer][]. The Python-based
library takes in a [JSON Schema][] and a JSON object or dict, and returns the
JSON  object with only fields that are specified in the schema. The main use
case for the library is taking Socorro crash reports, and whitelisting data that
is appropriate to be sent to Mozilla's Telemetry platform for analysis, removing
sensitive data that isn't meant to leave the crash report system.

## Roundtable
The Roundtable is the home for discussions that don't fit anywhere else.

### GTD
Last up was [ErikRose][], who brought up the [Getting Things Done][]
methodology and how he recently has adopted it to help deal with his personal
and professional time management. The video recording contains an extended
discussion of time management strategies, but useful tools highlighted during
the discussion include [Things][] (OSX only), [Org-Mode][], and good
old-fashioned sticky notes.
