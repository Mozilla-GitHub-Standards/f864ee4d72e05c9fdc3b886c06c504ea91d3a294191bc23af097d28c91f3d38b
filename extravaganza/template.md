Once a month, web developers from across Mozilla get together to do something.
Meanwhile, we find time to talk about the work that we've shipped, share the
libraries we're working on, meet new folks, and talk about whatever else is on
our minds. It's the Webdev Extravaganza! The meeting is open to the public; you
should stop by!

You can check out the [wiki page][wiki] that we use to organize the meeting, or
view a [recording of the meeting][recording] in Air Mozilla. Or just read on for
a summary!

## Shipping Celebration
The shipping celebration is for anything we finished and deployed in the past
month, whether it be a brand new site, an upgrade to an existing one, or even a
release of a library.

## Open-source Citizenship
Here we talk about libraries we're maintaining and what, if anything, we need
help with for them.

## New Hires / Interns / Volunteers / Contributors
Here we introduce any newcomers to the Webdev group, including new employees,
interns, volunteers, or any other form of contributor.

## Roundtable
The Roundtable is the home for discussions that don't fit anywhere else.
